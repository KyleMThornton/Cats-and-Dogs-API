    "A house cat’s genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle ancestors, says Layla Morgan Wilde, a cat behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101. These behaviors include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing, chinning, and urine marking.",
    "Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.",

    "Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).",
    "Cats can jump up to six times their length.",
    "Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.",
    "Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these bones are buried in their shoulder muscles.",
    "Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.",
    "Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at you with her mouth open from time to time.",

    "Cats have nearly twice the amount of neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs.",

    "Cats use their long tails to balance themselves when they’re jumping or walking along narrow ledges.",
    "Cats use their whiskers to “feel” the world around them in an effort to determine which small spaces they can fit into. A cat’s whiskers are generally about the same width as its body. (This is why you should never, EVER cut their whiskers.)",
    "Cats walk like camels and giraffes: They move both of their right feet first, then move both of their left feet. No other animals walk this way.",
    "Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while female cats are more likely to be right-pawed.",

    "Cats have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.",
    "Cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.",

    "Cats may yawn as a way to end a confrontation with another animal. Think of it as their “talk to the hand” gesture.",

    "When your cat sticks his butt in your face, he is doing so as a gesture of friendship.",
